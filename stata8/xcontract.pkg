d xcontract: Make data set of frequencies and percents on disk or in memory
d xcontract is an extended version of contract. It creates a data set with one
d observation per combination of values of a list of variables in the existing
d data set and new variables containing the frequency and percent of each
d combination, and, optionally, the cumulative frequency and percent of each
d combination. A list of by-variables can be used with xcontract, and the
d percents will then be calculated within by-groups. The output data set may
d either be listed to the Stata log, or saved to a disk file, or written to the
d memory (overwriting any existing data set).
