d kmest: Compute Kaplan-Meier survival probabilities and/or percentiles as estimation results
d kmest is intended for use in a survival time dataset set up by stset.
d It computes Kaplan-Meier survival probabilities (as computed by sts
d generate) for a list of times (sorted in ascending order), and/or
d Kaplan-meier percentiles for a list of percents (srted in ascending
d order), and saves them as estimation results, without a variance
d matrix.  kmest is intended for use with the bootstrap prefix, or
d possibly with the jackknife prefix, to create confidence intervals for
d the Kaplan-Meier survival probabilities and/or percentiles, possibly
d allowing for clustering and/or sampling-probability weighting.
d Alternatively, kmest can be used with the SSC packages parmest and 
d esetran to compute Greenwood confidence intervals, or delta-Greenwood
d confidence intervals using a variety of Normalizing transforms.
