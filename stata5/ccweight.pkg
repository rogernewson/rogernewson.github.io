d ccweight: module to generate inverse sampling probability weights
d ccweight takes, as input, a varlist whose distinct values
d correspond to case groups, and a status variable (1 for cases, 0
d for controls) in the option status. It creates, as output, a new
d variable, suitable for use as a pweight variable when the
d case-control study is analysed by regression with robust
d variances.
