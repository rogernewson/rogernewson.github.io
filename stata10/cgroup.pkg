d cgroup: Group contiguous observations with identical values of a varlist
d cgroup inputs a list of variables specified by a varlist, and
d generates, as output, a new integer-valued variable,
d indicating, in each observation, membership of a group of
d contiguous observations with identical values of the varlist.
d It is therefore a non-sorting version of gsort.
