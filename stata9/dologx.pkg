d dologx: Multiple versions of dolog for executing certification scripts
d dologx (like dolog) causes Stata to execute the commands stored in a do-file
d named filename.do as if they were entered from the keyboard, and echos the
d commands as it executes them, creating a log file filename.log. The dologx
d package contains multiple versions of dolog, written in multiple Stata
d versions, intended for use when running certification scripts. Usually, a
d do-file should contain a version statement at or near the top, so it will
d still run in the Stata version in which it was written, even if the user runs
d it under a later version of Stata. Certification scripts are an exception to
d this rule, because they are run under multiple Stata versions, to certify
d that the package being tested works under all of these versions. A
d certification script therefore should not contain a version statement at the
d top. The version of Stata under which it run will therefore be the version in
d force in the program that calls it, even if that program is dolog. The
d standard version of dolog should therefore not be used to run a certification
d script, and the user should use the dologx package instead, using dolog6 to
d run it under Stata 6, dolog7 to run it under Stata 7, and so on.
