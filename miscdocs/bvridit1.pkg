d bvridit1: Bivariate ridits and distribution theory for Kendall's tau-a
d This document intrroduces bivariate ridits and their role in defining
d the asymptotic sampling distribution of the sample Kendall's tau-a.
d This asymptotic distribution can be used to do power and sample size
d calculations for Kendall's tau-a by numerical integration, using the
d SSC packages expgen, normalbvr and powercal.
