d asy2con1: Asymptotic distributions of two-sample rank statistics
d This document summarizes the asymptotic distributions of two-sample
d rank statistics for continuous outcomes. The rank statistics discussed
d are Somers' D, Harrell's c, Hodges-Lehmann percentile differences, and
d differences between percentiles. It is not generally assumed that the
d two samples are from equally variable subpopulations.
