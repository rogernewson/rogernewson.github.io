d mdexp1: Hodges-Lehmann median differences between exponential subpopulations
d This gives formulas for the Hodges-Lehmann median difference between values,
d in 2 subpopulations, of an outcome variable, which has an exponential
d distribution within each subpopulation. The median difference is not equal
d to the difference between medians, except if the two exponential
d subpopulation distributions are the same.
